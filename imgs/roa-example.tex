  \caption[Region of attraction illustrative example.]{Region of attraction
    illustrative example. The plane is the phase-plane of a second order system.
    Each colored region represents one mode's contraints, each symbol inside a
    circle represents a point of interest: \(\bullet\) is the initial state, \(\diamond\) are
    the waypoints and \(\star\) the final reference, as set by the operator. The
    dashed circles represent each controller's Region of Attractoin. The arrows
    show the path the system will take as the supervisor changes the references
    to the waypoints and then to \(\star\). Arrows in solid line mean the system is
    entirely on the active mode, dashed arrows mean the system is on a hybrid
    state.}%
