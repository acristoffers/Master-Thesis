\begin{abstract}
  The command governor (\CG{}) is a useful strategy to avoid constraints violation
  in case of control reconfiguration or operational conditions changes, like
  switched systems mode changes. In general, the structure of the \CG{} specializes
  in producing an alternative reference signal to drive a closed-loop system to
  the desired reference while avoiding constraints violations in the control
  signal, state-space, or combinations of them. In this paper, we propose a
  simple strategy that modifies the conventional structures of the \CG{} and
  supervisor, yielding a switched rule based on the estimated controllers'
  region of attraction. We present some simulations to illustrate the proposal's
  potential and compare it with a competitor scheme exploiting a dwell-time
  approach. The results suggest that our approach adds new possibilities of \CG{}
  and supervisor design, reducing the transition time between system modes and
  improving the closed-loop performance indexes.
