\subsection{Level Control System}%
\label{subsec:tanks-system}

Consider an interactive tank system as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:tanks-sim}.
It consists of two coupled tanks, namely \(T1\) and \(T2\), that are feed by two
with controlled outflows \(u_1\) and \(u_2\), measured in
\si{\cubic\centi\metre\per\second}. The levels of each tank, \(h_1\) and \(h_2\)
(\si{\centi\metre}), are the control objective variables.

\input{imgs/tanks-sim}

The output flow of the \(T1\) and \(T2\) are denoted by \(q_1\) and \(q_2\)
(\si{\cubic\centi\metre\per\second}), respectively, and the flow between them is
noted by \(q_{12}\) (\si{\cubic\centi\metre\per\second}).

Both tanks have the same cross-section area, denoted as \(A\)
(\si{\square\centi\metre}), as well as the cross-section areas of the restrictions in
the outputs of the tanks, \(a\) (\si{\square\centi\metre}); \(g\)
(\si{\centi\metre\per\square\second}) is the gravity acceleration. By using
Bernoulli's equations, we have:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:formula-height-variation-lin}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dot{h}_1(t) & = \frac{u_1(t)-q_1(t)\pm{}q_{12}}{A}, \\
    \dot{h}_2(t) & = \frac{u_2(t)-q_2(t)\mp{}q_{12}}{A},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where the flows are given by \(q_1(t) = a\sqrt{2gh_1(t)}\),
\(q_2(t) = a\sqrt{2gh_2(t)}\), and
\(q_{12}(t) = a\sqrt{2g\left|h_2(t)-h_1(t)\right|}\).

This is a nonlinear and switching system, as the model changes depending on the
height of the tanks' water column. At each mode, \(h_1>h_2\) or \(h_1\leq h_2\),
equation~\eqref{eq:formula-height-variation-lin} can be linearized around an
equilibrium operational point \((x_{eq},u_{eq})\) by using Jacobian matrices. In
what follows, we use \(a=5.9\), \(A=961\pi{}\), and \(g=980.665\).

Two operational conditions with
\(x(k) = \begin{bmatrix}h_1(k) & h_2(k)\end{bmatrix}^\top{}\), are such that:
%
\begin{equation*}
  x_{eq}^1 =\! \begin{bmatrix}
    57.5 \\ 43.61
  \end{bmatrix}\!,
  u_{eq}^1 =\! \begin{bmatrix}
    744 \\ 2960
  \end{bmatrix}\!,
  x_{eq}^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
    43.61 \\ 57.5
  \end{bmatrix}\!,
  u_{eq}^2 =\! \begin{bmatrix}
    2960 \\ 744
  \end{bmatrix}\!,
\end{equation*}
%
yielding two operational modes, each of them corresponding to a \CG{}.\@
%
After the linearization, we discretized the continuous-time model using a sample
time of \SI{5}{\second} and Euler equations to get discrete-time model given
by~\eqref{eq:state-space} with matrices:
%
\begin{align*}
  A_1 & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.92  & 0.053 \\
    0.053 & 0.91
  \end{bmatrix}, ~~~ A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
    0.91  & 0.053 \\
    0.053 & 0.92
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  B_1 & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.0016          & 4.5\cdot10^{-5} \\
    4.5\cdot10^{-5} & 0.0016
  \end{bmatrix},
  B_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
    0.0016          & 4.5\cdot10^{-5} \\
    4.5\cdot10^{-5} & 0.0016
  \end{bmatrix},                              \\
  %
  C_1 & = C_2 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}
%
and \(s=2\). Using Lyapunov's and Kalman's
approaches~\parencite{chen:linear,hespanha:linear} we got the following
controller and observer gains:
%
\begin{align*}
  K_1 & = \begin{bmatrix}
    -875.384 & -9.217   & -297.447 & 7.982    \\
    -8.505   & -849.853 & 8.514    & -279.434
  \end{bmatrix}, \\
  %
  K_2 & = \begin{bmatrix}
    -849.853 & -8.505   & -279.434 & 8.514    \\
    -9.217   & -875.384 & 7.982    & -297.447
  \end{bmatrix}, \\
  %
  L_1 & = \begin{bmatrix}
    -0.919 & -0.053 \\
    -0.053 & -0.915
  \end{bmatrix},
  %
  L_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
    -0.915 & -0.053 \\
    -0.053 & -0.919
  \end{bmatrix},   \\
\end{align*}
%
for the operational modes \(1\) and \(2\).

We simulated our approaches described by algorithm~\ref{alg:roa-rule} to switch
between the \CG{}s 1 and 2. In both cases the system starts in \(x(0) =
\begin{bmatrix}43.61 & 57.5\end{bmatrix}\). The references are \(r =
\begin{bmatrix}57.5 & 43.61\end{bmatrix}\), for \(0\leq k\leq 10 \cup 50 \leq k
\leq\infty{}\), and \(r = \begin{bmatrix}43.61& 57.5\end{bmatrix}\), for \(11
\leq k \leq 49\). Therefore, the system must perform a closed path.

Fig.~\ref{fig:states} shows the path taken by the closed-loop system over the
space of the system's state. The trajectory marked with
\textcolor{red}{red-dashed line} concerns the results achieved without
early-switch, and the \textcolor{blue}{solid-blue line} is related to ones with
early-switch. The shadow regions concern the constraints of each mode. Also,
Fig.~\ref{fig:states} shows the borders of the estimates of the regions of
attraction, RoA, for each mode, with dot-dashed lines.

It is clear that the path taken under each algorithm are almost the same. The
respective control signals are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:control-signals}, pointing
to no relevant difference between the methods.

With the same procedures and considerations of the previous example, including
the used color codes, we simulated the unstable system.
Figure~\ref{fig:unstable-states} shows the same system trajectory for both
methods.

\end{figure}

The second method shows better performance under control signal restrictions.
Figure~\ref{fig:unstable-control-signals} reveals a difference in the control
signals, where the first method, displayed in \textcolor{red}{red dashed-line}
and \textcolor{green}{green dashed-line}, have higher control signal outputs
than the second method, shown by \textcolor{blue}{blue solid-line} and
\textcolor{orange}{orange solid-line}.

Both methods results in the same settling time, but with much lower control
effort with the strategy of early switching.

\subsection{Cessna 182}%
\label{subsec:cessna}

\textcite{franz√®.lucia.ea:command} present a Cessna 182 aircraft model, which
they used to simulate the dwell-time technique they proposed. They describe the
model, the operation points they chose, and the constraints applied to it. As
with the tank, we used the same system changing only the switch technique to
compare the performance. The proposed technique took \SI{6}{\second} to
converge, whereas the dwell-time technique took over \SI{20}{\second}.

Figure~\ref{fig:cessna-u} shows both actuators' control signals, which are kept
mostly invariant, except at the mode transitions, where the integrator reset
created a discontinuity. Figure~\ref{fig:cessna-x} shows each state. In both
figures, the solid black lines at the plot's top and bottom are the signal's
constraints. The last state (\(x_{4}\)) is the output, and its plot also shows
the reference and command governor's output.

\section{Experimental Results}%
\label{sec:experimental-results}

Consider an interactive tank system as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:tanks}. It
describes the physical system present at the System Analysis Laboratory of
CEFET-MG campus V, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tanks-real}. It consists of two
coupled tanks, \(T1\) and \(T2\), that are fed by a pump with controlled flow
\(u(t)\), measured in \si{\cubic\centi\metre\per\second}. The levels of each
tank, \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) (\si{\centi\metre}), are the control objective
variables.

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{imgs/tanks}
  \caption{Tank system diagram}%
  \label{fig:tanks}
\end{figure}

Both tanks have the same cross-section area, denoted as \(A\)
(\si{\square\centi\metre}), however, there is a solid inside \(T1\) that makes its
area non-linear and adds uncertainties to its model. The cross-section area of
\(T1\) becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t1-area}
  A_{1}(h_{1}(t)) = \frac{3r}{5} \left(
  2.7r - \frac{cos(2.5\pi{}((h_{1}(t)-8)\cdot{}10^{-2}-\mu))}{\sigma{}\sqrt{2\pi}}
  e^{-\frac{((h_{1}(t)-8)\cdot{}10^{-2}-\mu^{2})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
  \right),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\mu=0.4\), \(\sigma=0.55\) and \(r=0.31\). The cross-section area of \(T2\) is
\(\SI{0.31}{\square\metre}\).

By using Bernoulli's equations, the system's dynamics can be described by:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:formula-height-variation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dot{h}_1(t) & = \frac{R_{12}(h_{1}(t),h_{2}(t))\cdot{}K_{b}\cdot{}u(t)-h_{1}(t)+h_{2}(t)}
    {A_{1}(h_{1}(t))\cdot{}R_{12}(h_{1}(t),h_{2}(t))}                                                                 \\
    \dot{h}_2(t) & = \frac{h_{1}(t)-h_{2}(t)}{R_{12}(h_{1}(t),h_{2}(t))\cdot{}A_{2}} - \frac{q_{o}(h_{2}(t))}{A_{2}},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where \(R_{12}(h_{1}(t),h_{2}(t))=(0.412(h_{1}(t-h_{2}(t))+11.488)\cdot{}10^{-3}\)
and \(q_{o}(h_{2}(t))=11.941h_{2}(t)+787.586\). A frequency inverter controls
the pump through the percentage of maximum flow, and this value can be converted
to flow by \(q_{i}=13.201u_{t}+220.085\). Applying this before inputing in
Equation~\eqref{eq:formula-height-variation} results in \(u(t)\) becoming this
percentual value instead of the flow directly.

We chose four operation points to cover a significant portion of the available
\(h_{1}\) range (0 to \SI{70}{\centi\metre}). The points and their respective
linearized and discretized (with a sampling time of \SI{5}{\second}) systems are

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:op-points}
  \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      x_{eq}^{\top} & u_{eq} \\
      \hline
      A             & B
    \end{array}\right]_{1} & = \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
      19.5  & 5    & 15     \\
      \hline
      0.91  & 0.14 & 0.028  \\
      0.085 & 0.9  & 0.0013
    \end{array}\right], \\
  \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      x_{eq}^{\top} & u_{eq} \\
      \hline
      A             & B
    \end{array}\right]_{2} & = \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
      27.5  & 11.6 & 20     \\
      \hline
      0.94  & 0.19 & 0.04   \\
      0.084 & 0.9  & 0.0018
    \end{array}\right], \\
  \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      x_{eq}^{\top} & u_{eq} \\
      \hline
      A             & B
    \end{array}\right]_{3} & = \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
      37.3  & 17.8 & 25     \\
      \hline
      1.1   & 0.47 & 0.1    \\
      0.086 & 0.92 & 0.0042
    \end{array}\right], \\
  \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
      x_{eq}^{\top} & u_{eq} \\
      \hline
      A             & B
    \end{array}\right]_{4} & = \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
      47.4  & 24.9 & 30     \\
      \hline
      0.49  & 0.96 & 0.22   \\
      0.053 & 0.95 & 0.0096
    \end{array}\right].
\end{align}

To develop the controllers we applied the LMI described in the
subsection~\ref{sec:region-of-attraction} -~\nameref{sec:region-of-attraction}
to the integral-augmented system. The points forced to be inside the region of
attraction are the previous' and next's operation point. It creates an
intersection that allows the early switching of controllers, which speeds up
convergence. The following controllers were obtained:

\begin{align}
  K_{1} & = \begin{bmatrix} -12.884 & -97.540 & -13.975 \end{bmatrix}, \\
  K_{2} & = \begin{bmatrix} -10.054 & -73.777 & -10.523 \end{bmatrix}, \\
  K_{3} & = \begin{bmatrix} -5.840  & -31.622 & -4.148 \end{bmatrix}, \\
  K_{4} & = \begin{bmatrix} -1.832  & -21.527 & -4.177 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}

To calculate each of the described modes' dwell-time, we applied the technique
described by~\textcite{franz√®.lucia.ea:command}. We then ran both approaches ---
the dwell-time and the proposed one --- on the physical system.
Figures~\ref{fig:tanks-dwell} and~\ref{fig:tanks-roa} show the result of the
experiments.

The proposed technique has a faster overall convergence, entering the final mode
after 215 seconds while the dwell-time approach takes 340 seconds. The proposed
approach also shows no overshoot, since it does not give the system enough time
to converge to the waypoints and keeps it always moving towards the reference.
Because of that, it also has a smaller control effort, producing smaller control
signal variation.

The last mode should also have an overshoot on the proposed technique. However,
the command governor's optimization problem generated virtual references that
slowly guided the system to the real reference, making it take longer than
necessary to converge. The behaviour was present on every test repetition, just
like the dwell-time approach's overshoots.
