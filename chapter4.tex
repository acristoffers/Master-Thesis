\chapter{Practical Implementation Aspects}%
\label{chp:practival-implementation-aspects}

When implementing the techniques described in this thesis, some details need
attention. For example, it is easy to say
\enquote{\(\mathrm{minimize}~f(x)~|~x\in\mathcal{X}\)}, however it is not so
simple (and sometimes even possible) to implement the \(x\in\mathcal{X}\) bit.
Describing the set and finding a way to test membership numerically can be
challenging. That is one reason why we choose convex sets: we know how to
implement membership tests and use it in common optimization frameworks.

This chapter will discuss how to represent the constraints and region of
attraction and provide some insight into how to implement the models of the
command governor with a supervisor structure, and the problems faced when
estimating the region of attraction.

\section{Polytope representations}%
\label{sec:polytope-representation}

A convex polytope can approximate any convex region. A convex polytope is a
compact convex set with a finite number of extreme points such that, for any two
distinct points \((a,b)\) belonging to the region, a closed segment with
endpoints \((a,b)\) is entirely contained within the
region~\parencite{gr√ºnbaum:convex}. In other words, it is a convex hull of a
finite number of points, called vertices. This representation is called the
\enquote{V-representation} and is not useful to test membership. However, it is
straightforward to sample points from the desired region's border to create a
V-representation of a polytope approximating it. It is also useful for plotting.
The Figure~\ref{fig:v-rep-example} illustrates a region in its V-representation,
where the red dots are the vertices, and all blue dots are inside the region.
The set of vertices is \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
  \(\{(0.02,0.71),(0.31,0.02),(0.82,0.04),(0.87,0.13),(0.99,0.88),(0.60,0.98),(0.38,0.97),(0.04,0.88),(0.02,0.82)\}\)}.

  \label{fig:v-rep-example}
\end{figure}

A more useful representation of such regions is the \enquote{H-representation}.
In this representation, the intersection of a finite number of half-spaces
describes the region. A half-space is one of the two parts in which a
hyper-plane divides an affine space. Since half-spaces are linear inequalities,
the H-representation becomes the matrix inequality
%
\begin{equation}
  Ax\leq{}b,
\end{equation}
%
where \(A\) is a matrix of coefficients, \(x\) is a point in space and \(b\) is
a vector of real numbers. The number of rows in \(A\) and \(b\) is the same as
the number of half-spaces defining the region. All points satisfying the
inequality are in the region's interior, making it easy to test set membership.
Figure~\ref{fig:h-rep-example} shows the half-spaces that compose the
H-representation of the same convex polytope presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:v-rep-example}. Equation~\ref{eq:h-rep-example} shows the
inequation that describes the region. The selected side is not shown for each
half-space but is the one in which intersections with the other selected halves
make the convex region in the middle.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:h-rep-example}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -0.91 & -0.39 \\
    0.04  & -0.99 \\
    0.98  & -0.15 \\
    0.84  & -0.54 \\
    -0.24 & 0.96  \\
    0.24  & 0.97  \\
    -0.06 & 0.99  \\
    -0.99 & 0.03  \\
    -0.93 & 0.34
  \end{bmatrix}x \leq
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -0.30 \\
    -0.01 \\
    0.84  \\
    0.66  \\
    0.84  \\
    1.10  \\
    0.94  \\
    0.00  \\
    0.26
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \caption{Visualization of the H-representation of a set}%
  \label{fig:h-rep-example}
\end{figure}

Given that the V-representation is easier to obtain from generic shapes, but the
H-representation is more useful when verifying set membership, it is essential
to have a way to switch between them. Unfortunately, this is not
straightforward, but some algorithms allow us to enumerate the facets given the
vertices. Some problems of such algorithms are the time needed to find the
facets of many vertices and how to find facets in higher-order spaces. However,
good algorithms can be used for the conversion, especially if the computation
will be offline
\parencite{avis.bremner.ea:how,graham.frances-yao:finding,lee:on,mccallum.avis:linear}.

Particular regions can be easily described in a way that is easy to include in
optimization problems. The ellipsoid is one such region, as it is described as
\(x^{\top}Px\leq{}1\) so that any point \(x\) that satisfies the inequality is inside
the region. Any region described by polynomials can be expressed in a matrix
form and can quickly test membership. Such regions should use their inequation
directly instead of a polytope approximation. We do that to the Region of
Attraction, and it is how we implemented the check to verify if the state is
inside it.

\section{Internal Models}%
\label{sec:internal-models}

To switch modes and controllers of a system the way we propose, one must pay
attention to the controller's internal states and the control signal's
continuity. Also, since every \CG{} unit has its controller and model, the
destination \CG{} must be updated to a valid state before switching. There are
many ways to do so, and we will present some.

One way is to run all \CG{}s in parallel. The optimization problem of the
inactive units does not need to run with complete constraints. It can be relaxed
only to contain the region constraint on the virtual reference; also, the
observer can be ignored. It is necessary to find the virtual reference, which
will be close to the constraint region's border, which is closest to the real
system's state. Notice that, in this case, we are not looking for a virtual
reference closest to the real reference but to the real system's state. By doing
so, the internal model's and the controller's states will always be valid.

However, this approach can be resource-intensive, as it still computes the
optimization problem at every sample. It is also possible to run the observer
and update the internal model's states without checking for constraint
violations, but this does not solve the controller's state problem. Another
technique needs to be combined to find them.

Another way of guaranteeing valid states is to compute the states before
changing mode. Two ways of computing the states are: by inverting the system and
controller equations and by simulation. The first approach has a very low
computational resource impact but may not be possible or yield not ideal values.
For systems with integrators, for example, there will be infinitely many
results. Another problem is that even though the system has only one
steady-state solution, it can have many transient ones.

The simulation becomes interesting, even though it is more computationally
intensive, as it can calculate a state that better matches the current
transitory characteristics of the real system. It can also find the model's and
controller's states at once, guaranteeing that there is no mismatch. To use the
simulation approach, execute the simulation right before changing modes, using
the internal controller and model, and setting the reference to the real
system's current state. This yields a valid steady-state model's and
controller's state. However, this technique does not guarantee control signal
continuity (which might even be impossible on some systems) without adjustments.

\section{Region of Attraction Estimation}%
\label{sec:roa-estimation}

The Lyapunov approach presented in Section~\ref{sec:region-of-attraction} can
easily estimate the region of attraction. The presented approach makes use of a
quadratic Lyapunov candidate, but it is not necessary, as it is possible to find
functions of any form. The function should easily to check if a point belongs to
the region, as it will be done frequently. Quadratic forms, such as the simple
one presented or those generated by Sum Of Squares techniques, are recommended
since they easily and computationally inexpensively check set membership.

The region of attraction needs to be larger than the constraints region and
needs to intersect all mode's regions of attraction to and from which it can
switch. Because of this, it is necessary to guarantee the intersection. However,
LMIs usually try to optimize the size of the region of attraction by making it
as big as possible or as small as possible. Since the exponential stability
tries to minimize the size of the region of attraction, we need a way to ensure
a minimum region size.

Consider the region of attraction described by
%
\begin{equation}
  x^{\top}Px \le{} 1,
\end{equation}
%
where \(x\) is the point that should be inside the region of attraction. (Note
that, numerically, a number smaller than \(1\) may be necessary to make the
problem feasible).

If the LMI is written in terms os \(P\), it can be used directly to force the
region to be big enough to contain the point \(x\). If the LMI is written in
terms of \(P^{-1}\), simply applying Schur's complement yields a valid LMI:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lmi-point-inside-roa}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    P^{-1}   & x \\
    x^{\top} & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \succ \mathbf{0},
\end{equation}

You need to add one of such LMIs to your optimization problem for each mode that
is allowed to switch from or to the current mode. The point \(x\) does not need
to be the same for two modes that intersect, as placing the points some distance
apart creates a larger region of intersection, which gives a margin for errors.

To illustrate the choice of \(x\), consider the switched system composed of
three modes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:choice-x-roa-diff}. The stars represent
each mode's linearization point, the filled ellipses its constraints regions,
the unfilled circles the regions of attractions and the black dots the points
used in the LMIs to ensure the RoA's size. Note the intersection region formed
in the middle, displayed in yellow.

Now compare it with the same system, but only one point used for all systems,
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:choice-x-roa-same}. See how smaller is the
intersection of regions of attraction and constraints (in yellow). The proposed
technique will be much more efficient in the first case, since it will result in
an earlier switch.
