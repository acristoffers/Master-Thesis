\chapter{Final Considerations}%
\label{chp:final-considerations}

The presented technique allows faster overall convergence of constrained
switched systems while ensuring stability after switches. It is based on
well-consolidated concepts and builds on them to provide stability to
constrained switched systems. Although it was not designed to be used without a
Command Governor, the rule can be further extended to guarantee stability in
that case as well.

The major problem with the technique is that it is hard to apply it to existing
controllers since their region of attraction might not satisfy the necessary
criteria of size and intersections. Because of this, the main advantage of the
Command Governor is lost and new controllers will most probably need to be
synthetized.
