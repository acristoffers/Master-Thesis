\chapter{Practical Implementation Aspects}%
\label{chp:practival-implementation-aspects}

When implementing the techniques described in this thesis, some details need
attention. For example, it is easy to say
\enquote{\(\mathrm{minimize}~f(x)~|~x\in\mathcal{X}\)}, however it is not so
simple (and sometimes even possible) to implement the \(x\in\mathcal{X}\) bit.
Describing the set and finding a way to test membership numerically can be
challenging. That is one reason why we choose convex sets: we know how to
implement membership tests and use it in common optimization frameworks.

This chapter will discuss how to represent the constraints and region of
attraction and provide some insight into how to implement the models of the
command governor with a supervisor structure, the problems faced when resetting
integrators and estimating the region of attraction.

\section{Polytope representations}%
\label{sec:polytope-representation}

A convex polytope can approximate any convex region. A convex polytope is a
compact convex set with a finite number of extreme points such that, for any two
distinct points \((a,b)\) belonging to the region, a closed segment with
endpoints \((a,b)\) is entirely contained within the
region~\parencite{gr√ºnbaum:convex}. In other words, it is a convex hull of a
finite number of points, called vertices. This representation is called the
\enquote{V-representation} and is not useful to test membership. However, it is
straightforward to sample points from the desired region's border to create a
V-representation of a polytope approximating it. It is also useful for plotting.
The Figure~\ref{fig:v-rep-example} illustrates a region in its V-representation,
where the red dots are the vertices, and all blue dots are inside the region.
The set of vertices is \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\(\{(0.02,0.71),(0.31,0.02),(0.82,0.04),(0.87,0.13),(0.99,0.88),(0.60,0.98),(0.38,0.97),(0.04,0.88),(0.02,0.82)\}\)}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/v-rep}
	\caption{Visualization of the V-representation of a set}%
	\label{fig:v-rep-example}
\end{figure}

A more useful representation of such regions is the \enquote{H-representation}.
In this representation, the intersection of a finite number of half-spaces
describes the region. A half-space is one of the two parts in which a
hyper-plane divides an affine space. Since half-spaces are linear inequalities,
the H-representation becomes the matrix inequality
%
\begin{equation}
	Ax\leq{}b,
\end{equation}
%
where \(A\) is a matrix of coefficients, \(x\) is a point in space and \(b\) is
a vector of real numbers. The number of rows in \(A\) and \(b\) is the same as
the number of half-spaces defining the region. All points satisfying the
inequality are in the region's interior, making it easy to test set membership.
Figure~\ref{fig:h-rep-example} shows the half-spaces that compose the
H-representation of the same convex polytope presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:v-rep-example}. Equation~\ref{eq:h-rep-example} shows the
inequation that describes the region. The selected side is not shown for each
half-space but is the one in which intersections with the other selected halves
make the convex region in the middle.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:h-rep-example}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-0.91 & -0.39 \\
		0.04  & -0.99 \\
		0.98  & -0.15 \\
		0.84  & -0.54 \\
		-0.24 & 0.96  \\
		0.24  & 0.97  \\
		-0.06 & 0.99  \\
		-0.99 & 0.03  \\
		-0.93 & 0.34
	\end{bmatrix}x \leq
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-0.30 \\
		-0.01 \\
		0.84  \\
		0.66  \\
		0.84  \\
		1.10  \\
		0.94  \\
		0.00  \\
		0.26
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/h-rep}
	\caption{Visualization of the H-representation of a set}%
	\label{fig:h-rep-example}
\end{figure}

Given that the V-representation is easier to obtain from generic shapes, but the
H-representation is more useful when verifying set membership, it is essential
to have a way to switch between them. Unfortunately, this is not
straightforward, but some algorithms allow us to enumerate the facets given the
vertices. Some problems of such algorithms are the time needed to find the
facets of many vertices and how to find facets in higher-order spaces. However,
good algorithms can be used for the conversion, especially if the computation
will be offline
\parencite{avis.bremner.ea:how,graham.frances-yao:finding,lee:on,mccallum.avis:linear}.

Particular regions can be easily described in a way that is easy to include in
optimization problems. The ellipsoid is one such region, as it is described as
\(x^{T}Px\leq{}1\) so that any point \(x\) that satisfies the inequality is inside
the region. Many regions described by polynomials can be expressed in a matrix
form and can quickly test membership. Such regions should use their inequation
directly instead of a polytope approximation.  We do that to the Region of
Attraction, and it is how we implemented the check to verify if the state is
inside it.
